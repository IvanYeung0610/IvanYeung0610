DISCO:
* Bootstrap is a frame work that allows us to easily style our website without actually having to create
a css file and manually style our site.
* When using ratio helper, the youtube link you use is not the one in the browser when you watch a video.
The format should be https://www.youtube.com/embed/{VIDEO_ID}
* <div>s are a major part of bootstrap and it is used to create various features that it provides such as grids,
forms, buttons, badges, etc...

QCC:
* Why is our scrollspy not going to our fourth tab when we scroll up?

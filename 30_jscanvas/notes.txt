QCC:
* What's the difference between a function with no parameters and a function with element handling?
    * is there an advantage to using a function with element handling because both appear to work

DISCO:
* getContext("2d"): gives ability to draw on element it gets context of
    * arc
        * draws arcs to circles
        * syntax: arc(x, y, radius, startAngle, endAngle) -OR- arc(x, y, radius, startAngle, endAngle, counterclockwise)
            * angles are measured in RADIANS
    * stroke
        * draws the border of the shape
        * syntax: ctx.stroke()
    * fill
        * fills current or given path 
        * syntax: fill(), fill(path), fill(fillRule), fill(path, fillRule)
    * fillStyle
        * used to specifies the color, gradient, or pattern 
        * syntax: ctx.fillStyle("property")
    * fillRect
        * draws DIRECTLY to the canvas meaning other outside styling functions like fill and stroke won't affect it
            * draws according to current fillStyle 
        * syntax: fillRect(x, y, width, height)
    * beginPath
        * starts a new path by emptying the list of sub-paths.
            * the fact that it "empties" other pre-existing paths seems pretty important for wiping it
        * syntax: ctx.beginPath()
    * clearRect
        * erases pixels in a rectangular area
        * syntax: clearRect(x, y, width, height)
* offsetX
    * provides the offset in the X coordinate of the mouse pointer between that event and the padding edge of the target node
    * syntax: e.offsetX (Mouse Event property)
* offsetY
    *  provides the offset in the Y coordinate of the mouse pointer between that event and the padding edge of the target node
    * * syntax: e.offsetY (Mouse Event property)

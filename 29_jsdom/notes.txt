.append
    * function used to add an element to a pre-existing element

.createElement
    * function that creates a new element
    * works with .append in order for element to appear 
    * in order for element to show on html when called, it can be appended to an element that is hardcoded into html(method we found)

.addEventListener
    * syntax: .addEventListener(action, function_name) [for the function_name DON'T include parenthesis]
    * there seems to be a way to write a function inside the syntax of .addEventListener, but need to explore further
